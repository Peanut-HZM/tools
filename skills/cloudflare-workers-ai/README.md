## How It Works

Claude Code automatically discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/` and suggests them when relevant:

```
You: "Set up a Cloudflare Worker with D1"
Claude: "Found cloudflare-worker-base and cloudflare-d1 skills. Use them?"
You: "Yes"
→ Production-ready setup, zero errors
```

## Bundled Agents

Some skills include **sub-agents** that can be invoked via the Task tool for specialized tasks:

| Bundle | Agents | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **design** | `a11y-auditor`, `favicon-crafter`, `image-prompter` | Accessibility audits, favicon generation, image prompts |
| **cloudflare** | `cloudflare-deploy`, `cloudflare-debug`, `d1-migration`, `worker-scaffold` | Deployment, debugging, migrations |

**Note**: Agents require manual installation to `~/.claude/agents/`:

```bash
# List available agents
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh list

# Install agents from a bundle
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh design
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh cloudflare

# Install all agents
./scripts/install-skill-agents.sh all

# Restart Claude Code to discover new agents
```

After installation, agents appear in the Task tool's available agents.

## Request a Skill

**Want a skill we don't have?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/jezweb/claude-skills/issues/new?template=skill_request.md&title=Skill+Request:+) with the technology/framework and we'll build it.

Popular requests get prioritized. No need to build it yourself unless you want to.

## Your Own Skills Repo

Want your own skills ecosystem with your own authorship? **Fork this repo** or use it as a template:

1. Fork → customize skills with your preferences
2. Use our QA agents (`content-accuracy-auditor`, `code-example-validator`, `version-checker`) to maintain currency
3. Pull upstream updates when useful

This works well if you maintain skills across multiple machines or want to publish your own collection.
